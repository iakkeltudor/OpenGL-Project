# OpenGL-Project
Uni project done in C++ with the help of the OpenGL library. The project consists of a rendered scene depicting a war-torn village, with destroyed tanks, houses, trees and bushes. I have also added 2 different light sources and shadows to the scene, as well as other different functionalities (see Documentation - User Manual)
